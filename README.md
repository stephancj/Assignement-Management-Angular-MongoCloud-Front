#Project Description
The goal of this project is to implement the following optional improvements to the existing application:

##Add Toolbar and SideBar/Sidenav: Introduce a Toolbar and a SideBar/Sidenav to enhance the presentation and navigation of the application.

##Implement Login/Password Management:

###Simple Case: 
Hardcode a valid login/password combinations directly in the authentication service.
Username: admin
Password: admin

##Enhance Assignment Model:

Added new properties to the Assignment model, including:
Author (student's name or photo)
Subject (e.g., Databases, Web Technologies, Grails, etc.)
Associate an image with each subject and include a photo of the instructor.
Included a "Grade out of 20" property. An Assignment cannot be marked as "submitted" unless it has been graded.

##Improvements to Assignment Display:
###Update various sections of the application where Assignments are displayed, edited, or entered.
Displayed each Assignment in the list as a Material Card, showing the title, date, student number, a small image representing the assignment.
In the edit dialog, included additional information such as remarks(comments) and the grade.

###Separated Assignments into two sections:
Differentiate between submitted and unsubmitted Assignments by displaying them in separate sections.
Implemented drag-and-drop functionality to move an Assignment from one section to another. By dragging an unsubmitted Assignment card to the "Submitted" section changes the Assignment's status to "Submitted."

###Use Stepper Form for Assignment Creation:
Implement a multi-step form (Stepper) for adding Assignments.

###Improving the UI:
Made the application visually appealing by incorporating individual design elements, ensuring that each enhancement is unique in appearance.
